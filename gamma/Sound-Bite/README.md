OBJECTIVE:
----------
The goal of speech to text summarization is to develop an automated system that can efficiently and accurately summarize spoken language into concise written text. The primary objective of such a system is to save time and effort while also allowing for greater accessibility for people who are unable to listen to the entire audio recording.

INPUT:
------
Audio files in WAV format. 
A simple HTML5/JS demo as a web browser (such as Google chrome) can that record voice in real time as WAV file with functionalities to pause and resume.
This audio file is then sent to a python flask server for NLP.

OUTPUT:
-------
Transcription of actual audio file is converted via NLP to obtain an abstracted summary of the audio piece.
